# rgbColorGame

## Synopsis
This is a rbg Color guessing game with two modes: easy and hard. This program uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Motivation

I created this via a web development video. Already familar with HTML and CSS, I wanted to learn and practice how to implement Javascript in a high level way. I also wanted to push the boundaries of my own knowledge and taste regarding the styling.
